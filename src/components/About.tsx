          </span>
          <p className="font-sans text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            My journey started by playing the music I loved from games and films on the piano. Those works made me want to learn the instrument properly, which naturally evolved into a passion for music theory and composition.
          </p>
          <p className="font-sans text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            While piano and orchestra are where I feel most at home, I enjoy experimenting with different ensembles and instruments. My process usually starts at the piano, playing around with ideas until something clicks, then gradually building the arrangement out from there.
          </p>
          <p className="font-sans text-muted leading-relaxed">
            On the professional side, my experience spans a wide variety of projects that include piano compositions, custom arrangements, full orchestral scoring, and transcription.
